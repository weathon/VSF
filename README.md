# VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By Value Sign Flip

Paper and benchmark coming soon
## Introduction
This project introduces a new method called Value Sign Flip (VSF) that improves how image generation models handle negative prompts.

Problem: Modern few-step text-to-image models often struggle to properly exclude concepts described in negative prompts. Existing methods (CFG) either don‚Äôt work well or require heavy changes to the model (NegationCLIP).

Solution (VSF): We propose a lightweight technique that flips the value vector of negative prompt embeddings during attention. This cancels out unwanted features without retraining or needing access to classifier-free guidance.

Key Advantages:

- ‚ö° Works with few-step and even single-step generation models (currently only supports SD3.5 and Flux).
- üîß Requires no model retraining.
- üö´ Avoids common issues like negative prompts being accidentally reinforcing the undesired concept.
- üéØ Includes attention masking and token duplication to isolate effects to only where needed.

## News
- üñºÔ∏è July 16, 2025: We now support Flux Dev and Flux Schnell
- üé® July 15, 2025: We open sourced our repo and has support for SD3.5-large-turbo

## Examples

This is SD3.5 examples, the green prompt is the positive prompt, and the red text is the negative prompt. 

[This video](flux_demo.mp4) shows a positive prompt of `a canadian winter landscape in the style of a 19th century painting` and negative prompt of `snow` at different scale, from 1 to 8.9 ([Code](flux_demo.py)). We can see as the scale increase the snow is decreasing. 

## Usage
You can clone this repo into your working folder, and execute the following code. We subjectively find that SD3.5 version is better at following negative prompt while Flux Schnell version has better quality. It seems like our method did not work well on Flux Dev. 

### SD3.5-large-turbo
```python
import torch
from src.pipeline import VSFStableDiffusion3Pipeline
pipe = VSFStableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large-turbo",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
).to("cuda")
prompt = "A poker table is set in the casino room, green felt stretched tight over the oval surface."
negative_prompt = "cards"
image_ours = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    guidance_scale=0.0, # This has to be 0
    num_inference_steps=8,
    scale=3.5,
    offset=0.1
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(19)
).images[0].save("demo.png")
```

A demo notebook and comparsion with [NAG](https://github.com/ChenDarYen/Normalized-Attention-Guidance/tree/main) can be found in [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb).

### Flux Schnell
```python
import torch
from src.flux_pipeline import VSFFluxPipeline
import numpy as np
import imageio

pipe = VSFFluxPipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")

prompt = "a canadian winter landscape in the style of a 19th century painting"
image = pipe(
    prompt,
    negative_prompt="snow on the ground",
    guidance_scale=0.0,
    num_inference_steps=8,
    max_sequence_length=256,
    scale=6,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(19)
).images[0].save("demo.png")
```

### Flux Dev
(Our method doesn't seem to work on Flux Dev)
```python
import torch
from src.flux_pipeline import VSFFluxPipeline
import numpy as np
import imageio

pipe = VSFFluxPipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to("cuda")

prompt = "a bike on a snowy road in the style of a 19th century painting"
image = pipe(
    prompt,
    negative_prompt="wheels",
    guidance_scale=0.0,
    num_inference_steps=32,
    max_sequence_length=256,
    scale=8,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(19)
).images[0].save("demo.png")
```
