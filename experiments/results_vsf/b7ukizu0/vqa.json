For Question 2, the shell is not missing or not visible; it's visible and has a detailed pattern on it, but since the question is about the shell being 'missing or not visible', and it is visible, the answer should be False. However, given the context that the turtle appears to be a representation and not a real turtle, and interpreting the question as whether the shell is a part of the turtle's body or an external feature, one might argue. Yet, based strictly on the information given and visible, the shell is visible. The quality of the image is high, with clear details of the turtle and its surroundings.
